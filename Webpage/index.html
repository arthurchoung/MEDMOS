<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The goal of this project is to recreate the MIDI features of the Atari ST, on x86 hardware.

<p>
For some reason, I am fascinated by the Atari ST and how it is capable of solid, tight MIDI timing.
Some consider it to be the "gold standard" for MIDI timing.

<p>
I have always been frustrated by modern computers with USB becoming the dominant interface for music.

<p>
Adding to that frustration are modern operating systems that become slower and slower over time with
higher and higher latency.

<p>
So this project is intended to be a single tasking operating system along the lines of an Atari ST
or a Commodore 64, with a focus on MIDI and audio in general, where the audio hardware is accessed
directly, with nothing getting in the way.

<p>
I have never actually used an Atari ST before. I don't even think I have ever seen one in person.
During that era, I had a Commodore Amiga, and before that, a Commodore 64. I did not realize at the
time that the Atari ST is more of a successor to the Commodore 64, and the Commodore Amiga is more
of a successor to the Atari 800. The Atari ST has MIDI, while the Commodore 64 has the SID chip.

<p>
MED MOS builds upon another project, <a href="http://hotdoglinux.com">HOT DOG Linux</a>.

<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

<p>
One of the following:

<ul>
<li>Ensoniq AudioPCI 1370 (ES1370) (PCI ID: 0x50001274)
<li>Ensoniq AudioPCI 1371 (ES1371) (PCI ID: 0x13711274)
<li>Soundblaster Live (PCI ID: 0x00021102)
</ul>

<h3>Software Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>grub2
<li>xorriso
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
The Bare Bones tutorial at OSDev.org has provided the starting point for this project.

<p>
The Objective C runtime being used is the GCC runtime.

<h3>How To Build</h3>

<p>
First, build the toolchain. You can edit the scripts to parallelize the builds (i.e. make -j4).

<p>
$ cd Toolchain

<p>
$ sh build_binutils.sh

<p>
$ sh build_gcc.sh

<p>
$ cd ..

<p>
Next, build the Objective C runtime.

<p>
$ cd ObjectiveC

<p>
$ sh build.sh

<p>
$ cd ..

<p>
Next, build the kernel.

<p>
$ cd Kernel

<p>
$ sh build.sh

<p>
$ cd ..

<p>
It should display "Done" if it is successful. Otherwise there is a compile error.

<p>
Next, build the supporting code.

<p>
$ git clone https://github.com/arthurchoung/HOTDOG

<p>
$ perl build.pl

<p>
Note that you are running the build.pl script in the MEDMOS directory, not the HOTDOG directory.

<p>
This should create a binary file 'ISO/medmos'.

<p>
Next, make the iso.

<p>
$ sh make_iso.sh

<p>
This should create an .iso file.

<p>
Finally, you can use 'dd' to copy the .iso file to a USB stick, and boot from it.

<p>
I followed the Bare Bones tutorial at OSDev.org, and was able to get a basic system up and running.

<p>
It uses GRUB to boot a multiboot kernel into 640x480x32. GRUB and the way it selects a graphics mode
does not work consistently on my hardware, I've had the most luck with Nvidia. Long term, I am leaning
towards not using GRUB and simply using VGA mode 12h (640x480x4), since that should be good enough and
more compatible across my hardware.

<p>
I was able to get the Objective-C runtime up and running, as well as most of the code from HOTDOG.
This makes it easy to draw text using different fonts and so on. At the moment I am using the
Commodore 64 font and colors.

<p>
I am able to read input from the keyboard and mouse.

<p>
I am able to detect the ES1371, enable the UART, send MIDI data, as well as receive MIDI data and
indicate which notes are being played on the piano. I am currently polling, so the receive code is
hacky and very ugly. I really need to implement interrupts.

<p>
I was able to get the ES1370 and Soundblaster Live working as well.
